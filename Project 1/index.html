                <p><b>Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic[3] Indian revolutionary[4] who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer[5] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[6] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[7] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[8] he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.[9]</b></p>
